This Repository contains an incomplete inventory system.

The system is nearly complete as all that is necessary would be to add many details, such as different car parts 
The coded logic is complete, the inventory system moves between different windows based on what you select 
The code also changes what appears in various selection boxes based on what you input before 
The windows also show that you can save and delete what inventory you have

The reason I uploaded this version is to avoid liscencing and distribution issues
